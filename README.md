Description of the project at hand:


Utilizes Tasker on the phone to send an MQTT message to the raspberry pi 
which will trigger movements by a stepper motor to lightly tap the desk.
Then, the pi stores this information through a JSON file and clears the JSON
file when notifications have been read.
